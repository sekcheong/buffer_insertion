Please only fill in the function "options_filter"; it is commented as "filled by you" in the buffer.c file.

Note the requested output is only the required arrival time and capacitance load values at the root so it is not necessary to print the buffer locations.

Submit via "dropbox" tab in LearnUW.

Please only submit your "buffer.c" file. Do not submit your executables.

Your code should be compiled and run in CAE tux machines (best-tux.cae.wisc.edu) using the provided makefile.

This homework should be done individually.
